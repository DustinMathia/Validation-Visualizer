# Validation Visualizer Summary Document
## What
A data visualization project that: plots data as a rug plot, density histogram, or statistical fit; ag table data viewer; plots data as roc plot.
## Why
New molecular tests need to be validated by finding the optimal threshold that splits the positively diagnosed population from the negatively diagnosed population.
## How
Uses plotly dash and various python libraries to calculate roc curve, and other statistical values
## Results
The final program is a very intuitive and practical application for bioinformaticians, clinicians, and variant scientists to use to explore molecular test data.
